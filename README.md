# Twitter U.S.and India Politicians dataset

The Twitter U.S. and Indian Politicians dataset is provided for use by University of Michigan faculty, students, and their collaborators. The data is stored on Turbo at `/nfs/turbo/politweets` and is structured like the [Twitter Decahose for U-M](https://github.com/CSCAR/twitter-decahose).

# Requesting Access

[Use this form to apply for access](https://forms.gle/ofiY1dHWNXYK7kqo6). MIDAS will review your application, send you a copy of the memorandum of understanding between you and MIDAS that explains the date use terms.

The process for gaining access to the dataset is similar to the [Twitter Decahose Data](https://midas.umich.edu/twitter-decahose-data/). 

# Using the Data

[CSCAR's tutorials for the Twitter Decahose](https://github.com/caocscar/twitter-decahose-pyspark) are a great place to start. This data is similarly structured though it includes a different set of users.

# What's in the Data

We collect tweets posted by politicians in the U.S. and India and save the JSON provided by the Twitter API. Lists of politicians are generated by [NivaDuck](https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3400806.3400830), software developed at Microsoft Research - India for automatically identifying accounts that belong to politicians.  

As of **March 12, 2021**, the data includes:

* USA
	- Number of accounts: 9608 (8994 with state metadata)
* India
	- Number of political Twitter handles: 33074 (27300 with party metadata, 16027 with state metadata)

## Data Collection Process

Two scripts run daily, one each for India and the U.S., to pull new tweets posted everyday by each politician in the respective lists. For India, the list of accounts includes journalists, media outlets, celebrities, and influencers. The same set for the U.S. is still being compiled and the accounts will be updated in the future.

You can view the scripts for collection in the `scripts` folder.

## Data Structure

Data is stored in two folders, one each for India (`/nfs/turbo/politweets/india`) and the U.S. (`/nfs/turbo/politweets/usa`). Inside each, there are three folders: `~/tweets_par/`, `~/logs/`, `~/errors/`. The `~/tweets_par/` directory contains one sub-directory for each account being tracked, named for the user's public screen_name. For example, `/nfs/turbo/politweets/usa/tweets_par/realDonaldTrump/` contains tweets from former President Donald Trump. Inside every user's (politician's) directory, there are multiple compressed JSON files.

## Twitter User Metadata 

We are manually checking all accounts NivaDuck identified and will provide periodic metadata updates.

* [Current list of U.S. Accounts](metadata/usa/current.json)
* [Current list of India Accounts](metdata/india/current.json)

### Metadata Fields

* index: unique id in the dataset
* id: integer Twitter account ID
* id_str: string version of Twitter account ID
* screen_name: Twitter screen name of the account
* domain or confirmed_politician: boolean indicates whether this account has been affirmed
* state: U.S. state the official or candidate represents

Here's an example of the minimum metadata:

| index | 	id	| id_str	| screen_name |	domain or confirmed_politician |	state |
| ----- | ----- | --------- | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| 0	| 986781648	| 986781648	| jeffsessions	| 1	| Alabama |
| 1	| 	93351287	| 	93351287	| 	DevinPandy	| 	1	| 	Georgia	| 
| 2	| 	771105905538535424	| 	771105905538535424	| 	ChrisBishRE	| 	1	| 	California	| 
| 3	| 	914815520842616834	| 	914815520842616832	| 	NancyMace	| 	1	| 	South Carolina	| 
| 4	| 	1081292958048153601	| 	1081292958048153600	| 	Funk4Congress	| 	1	| 	To Be Added	| 

Archived metadata files are available in the `metadata` folder as well.

abstract = {We present a scalable methodology to identify Twitter handles of politicians in a given region and test our framework in the context of Indian and US politics. The main contribution of our work is the list of the curated Twitter handles of 18500 Indian and 8000 US politicians. Our work leveraged machine learning-based classification and human verification to build a data set of Indian politicians on Twitter. We built NivaDuck, a highly precise, two-staged classification pipeline that leverages Twitter description text and tweet content to identify politicians. For India, we tested NivaDuck’s recall using Twitter handles of the members of the Indian parliament while for the US we used state and local level politicians in California state and San Diego county respectively. We found that while NivaDuck has lower recall scores, it produces large, diverse sets of politicians with precision exceeding 90 percent for the US dataset. We discuss the need for an ML-based, scalable method to compile such a dataset and its myriad use cases for the research community and its wide-ranging utilities for research in political communication on social media. },
